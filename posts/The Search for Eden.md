My first and only blog: on [Blogger][1]; stuttered in 2004 and was abandoned after sporadic posting (24 in all) over 3 or so years.

There were two main reasons for stopping.  I didn’t have much to say or much reason to say it, and I wasn’t comfortable with the blogging tool (Blogger).

Now it’s time to try again.

## What to say

Since 2004 the role of the blog has changed. Personal thoughts and communications are better shared with friends and family on Facebook and other social media where feedback, community and sharing are better integrated. The blog is (IMHO) suited to more narrowly focussed material addressed to a less intimate community, in my case largely technical.

The areas I will be blogging on relate to Cilogi (provision of guides to collections of objects and places) and to the current web landscape in which guides are embedded. 

## How to say it

I want blogging to be part of my daily workflow. I have a daily work book. What I would like is to choose when to publish an entry and to push a button to get it done. If I later edit an entry there should be a button push to post the update. 

For years I’ve used a file-based diary, editing entries with Emacs using [Markdown][2]. This is backed up and versioned using Git. I’ve recently changed my editor in a multi-month experiment with [Ulysses app][3] on Mac and iOS.  I will keep using Ulysses _and_ the Git system by hooking Ulysses up with my blogging Git directory.

With this setup there are a couple of steps to publish a post. 
1. Export as Markdown to an appropriate posts directory.
2. Build locally (optional) to check that the site looks OK
3. Commit the Git repo.
4. (automatic) compile and publish site.
